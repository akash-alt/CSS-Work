    <h1>Monarchy of Denmark</h1>
    <p>
        The Monarchy of Denmark, colloquially known as the Danish Monarchy,
        is a constitutional institution and a historic office of the Kingdom of Denmark.
        The Kingdom includes Denmark proper, as well as the autonomous countries of the Faroe Islands and Greenland.
        The Kingdom of Denmark was already consolidated in the 8th century, 
        whose rulers are consistently referred to in Frankish sources 
        (and in some late Frisian sources) as "kings" (reges).
        Under the rule of King Gudfred in 803 the Kingdom may have included all the major
        provinces of medieval Denmark.[1] The current unified Kingdom of Denmark was founded 
         or re-united by the Viking kings Gorm the Old and Harald Bluetooth in the 10th century.
        Originally an elective monarchy, it became hereditary only in the 17th century during the reign of 
        Frederick III. A decisive transition to a constitutional monarchy occurred in 1849 with the writing 
        of the first Constitution. The current Royal House is a branch of the princely family of Gl√ºcksburg,
        originally from Schleswig-Holstein in modern-day Germany, the same royal house as the Norwegian and 
        former Greek royal families.

        The Danish Monarchy is constitutional and as such, the role of the monarch is defined and limited by the Constitution of Denmark.
        According to the constitution, the ultimate executive authority over the government of Denmark is still by and through the
        monarch's royal reserve powers; in practice these powers are only used according to laws enacted in Parliament or
        within the constraints of convention. The monarch is, in practice, limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing 
        honours and appointing the prime minister. The monarch and his or her immediate family undertake various official, 
        ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties.
