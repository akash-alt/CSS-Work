    <h1>Monarchy of Denmark</h1>

                  <div>
                      <p>Denmark is a Scandinavian country comprising the Jutland Peninsula and numerous islands. It's linked to nearby Sweden via the Öresund bridge. Copenhagen, its capital, 
                         is home to royal palaces and colorful Nyhavn harbor, plus the Tivoli amusement park and the iconic “Little Mermaid”
                           statue. Odense is writer Hans Christian Andersen’s hometown, with a medieval core of cobbled streets and half-timbered houses.

                        <p2>The Danish Monarchy is constitutional and as such, the role of the monarch is defined and limited by the Constitution of Denmark. 
                           According to the constitution, the ultimate executive authority over the government of Denmark is still by and through the monarch's 
                          royal reserve powers; in practice these powers are only used according to laws enacted in Parliament or within the constraints of 
                          convention. The monarch is, in practice, limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the prime minister.
                          The monarch and his or her immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties.
